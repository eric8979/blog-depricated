# 🐋 Coding Whale (programming blog)

This is Eric Whale's programming blog. I post programming stuff and my projects. <br>
This is my first long-term/production-level(?) project. I enjoyed every moment of the journey and learned a lot.😆 <br>
Welcome to my blog and feel free to use the source code if you want. Suggestions and advice are always welcomed just leave me an issue!

## Rules

1. Only push from local dir when there is bug fix, design update. NO GIT PUSH FOR BLOG POSTS! 
2. Post/update blog post ONLY ON GITHUB REPO.

## Used languages & tools

* Language: JavaScript (-> TypeScript soon)
* Package installer: npm
* Build: Gatsby (need React basics) - checkout source code for plugins
* Style: Scss
* Deploy: Netlify & GitHub page



<!--  types of websites 

- static website (SEO👍, speed & update👎)

  - uses static HTML pages, uploaded to a CDN / web host

- single page application (SEO👎, speed & update👍)

  - typical react/vue website
  - only a single server request made for the initial(empty) HTML page
  - everything else (routing, data) is handled by the SPA in the browser

- static site generator (SEO & speed & update👍) - Gatsby
  - compiled at build time (before deployment)
  - made with react/vue
  - after initial request, the site behaves like a SPA
