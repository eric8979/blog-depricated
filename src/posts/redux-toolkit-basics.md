#### Redux Toolkit

Redux has introduced Redux Toolkit. The toolest for efficient redux development. I just learned the basic and my first impression is that it enables developers to put every redux related codes in seperate files and let us write a minimum amount of code in react components.

[Redux Toolkit official page](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/)

#### Basics

⚠️ You should know the basics of redux and react-redux to understand my code.
⚠️ I use TypeScript in this project.

<br>

I made my own Redux Toolkit basics code. I made this from the original example code from redux. To clone my project, command the code below.

<br>

```shell
git clone https://github.com/eric8979/redux-toolkit-basics.git
```

<br>

If you want the original code, type command on terminal down below.

<br>

```shell
npx create-react-app <project name> --template redux-typescript
```

<br>

Both code has basic counting functionality using (ofcourse) redux and redux toolkit.
My code has minimum amount of code. I deleted styling, unnecessary components and testing files.

<br>

#### Brief description on my code

I recommend reading readme first. It's not even a reading, it just has what tools are used from react-redux and redux-toolkit. Code comments are the descriptions of each functions like `createSlice` or `createAsyncThunk`. Hope my code helps you to get basic understanding on redux-toolkit.
